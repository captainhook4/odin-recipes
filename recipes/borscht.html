    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>"Georgia O’Keeffe loved innovating in the kitchen and was known for her healthy dishes made with colorful ingredients—unsurprising, given her fondness for color in her paintings. For the 2017 book Dinner with Georgia O’Keeffe, published by Assouline, writer Robyn Lea dug through the artist’s notes to compile this cookbook, inspired by O’Keeffe’s favorite dishes that she either cooked herself or had served to her by her caretakers. One of the most colorful dishes in the book: Brightest Borscht with Sour Cream & Fresh Dill."</p>
