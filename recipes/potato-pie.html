    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>"If you’ve ever visited Monet’s home and studio in Giverny, France, you know that one of the most exceptional rooms in his home is the grand kitchen, clad in blue-and-white tiles and lined with copper pots. The Impressionist master was not only a painter but also a gourmand, delighting in hearty meals of which he kept copious notes in his culinary journal. In The Monet Cookbook by Florence Genter (Prestel, 2016), discover some of the artist’s favorite recipes, including this one for a rustic potato pie."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <b>For the pastry:</b>
        <ul>
          <li><em>4 cups flour</em></li>
          <li><em>17 tbsp butter, at room temperature</em></li>
          <li><em>2 egg yolks</em></li>
          <li><em>Salt</em></li>
        </ul>
      <b>For the filling:</b>
        <ul>
          <li><em>6 firm, medium-sized potatoes</em></li>
          <li><em>3 onions</em></li>
          <li><em>1 small bunch parsley</em></li>
          <li><em>150 ml heavy cream</em></li>
          <li><em>1 whole egg</em></li>
          <li><em>Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start by preparing the pastry: Cut the butter into small cubes and place in a bowl; add the flour with 1 pinch of salt, then mix together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Mix in the egg yolks and shape the dough into a ball</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Press out the dough with your palm, working from the center to the side to obtain a smooth dough. Repeat the process several times until the dough is even. Shape it into a ball again, wrap in plastic wrap, and leave to rest in the fridge for two hours</li>
        <li>When you are ready to use the pastry, preheat the oven to 180ºC (gas mark 4, or 350ºF)</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and slice into rounds. Soak the potato slices in cold water</li>
        <li>Peel the onions and cut into rounds</li>
        <li>Dice the parsley</li>
        <li>Take the pastry out of the fridge and divide it into two uneven-sized pieces</li>
        <li>Place the larger piece onto a floured surface and roll it out into a circle large enough to line the bottom and sides of a shallow, round, earthenware dish. The pastry should slightly overlap the side</li>
        <li>Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle just a little larger than the dish</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and dry them with a clean paper towel. Arrange them in the dish in a single layer and scatter with the onion rings and diced parsley. Season with salt and a generous amount of pepper, then add the cream</li>
        <li>Cover with the second circle of pastry, pinching the two sheets of pastry together to seal the edges</li>
