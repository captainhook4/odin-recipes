    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>"Despite describing British food in general as “simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous,” George did have a soft spot for this traditional English dessert, which doesn't actually contain any plums, but is full of dried fruit instead."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><em>1/2 cup butter, softened</em></li>
        <li><em>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</em></li>
        <li><em>3 large eggs, room temperature</em></li>
        <li><em>3/4 cup dry bread crumbs</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tbsp grated orange zest</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tsp ground cinnamon</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 tsp baking soda</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</em></li>
        <li><em>1/4 tsp salt</em></li>
        <li><em>1/4 tsp ground cloves</em></li>
        <li><em>2 cans (15 ounces each) plums, drained, pitted and chopped</em></li>
        <li><em>1-3/4 cups chopped dates</em></li>
        <li><em>1 cup golden raisins</em></li>
        <li><em>1 cup shredded carrots</em></li>
        <li><em>1/2 cup dried currants</em></li>

      </ul>
      <b>Hard sauce:</b>
        <ul>
          <li><em>1/2 cup butter, softened</em></li>
          <li><em>3 cups confectioners' sugar</em></li>
          <li><em>1/4 cup dark rum or orange juice</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Generously grease an 8-cup pudding mold, metal gelatin mold or ovenproof bowl; set aside</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. In another bowl, mix bread crumbs, flour, orange zest, cinnamon, baking soda, nutmeg, salt and cloves; gradually add to creamed mixture. Fold in plums, dates, raisins, carrots and currants</li>
        <li>Transfer to prepared pudding mold. Cover tightly with heavy-duty foil; tie foil with kitchen string to secure</li>
        <li>Place on a rack in a stockpot; add 3 in. hot water to pot. Bring water to a gentle boil; steam cake, covered, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 2 to 2-1/2 hours, adding more water to pot as needed. Remove pudding from pot; let stand 5 minutes before unmolding</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat hard sauce ingredients until smooth and creamy. Unmold pudding onto a serving plate; serve warm with sauce</li>
      </ol>
